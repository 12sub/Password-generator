# Password-generator
Writing a bunch of random strings to store passwords for python
Using python to create random passwords and storing them as a text file(.txt)
I wrote 3 functions for this project
The first one was to generate the passwords using the random module
the second one was to write the passwords to a file
The third was to read the passwords to a file.
The declaration was commented but you can uncomment it to run the code
Also the random password generator file would be placed in this github repo
